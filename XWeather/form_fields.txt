  description: Author - Javasavvy - This plugin will work with many personal weather stations including Ecowitt and Tempest. Any weather station that can publish to "PWS weather" or can transmit data to XWeather should work. If you have a PWS weather account, and an XWeather account, you can link your PWS Weather account to XWeather to gain free access to their API. For Example, if your weather station cannot publish directly to PWS Weather, create a PWS Weather account and add a new PWS. Then with a Tempest or Ecowitt (Or other Weewx supported weather station) on your local network, use a Raspberry Pi running Weewx to intercept UDP packets or query the station console endpoints via installing and configuring the appropriate weewx plugin for your station. Configure Weewx to publish your weather station data to the virtual PWS Weather station. Once PWS Weather activates your station, you can link it to your XWeather account. At this point you will create an "App" in XWeather, which will generate a Client ID and Secret token. Plug them into this plugin and you can use your TRMNL to see your private weather station data displayed. Feel free to reach out in the TRMNL Discord if you need help. This plugin uses a combination of Weather Icons provided by TRMNL and by <a href="https://github.com/erikflowers/weather-icons">Erik Flowers</a>
